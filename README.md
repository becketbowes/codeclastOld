# chronoclasts 1.1
chronoclasts are exactly the type of scum that would mix latin and greek roots, but, you know, in coding.

## this release
this is updated with flex in the articles so that it meets the requirement of having a larger card in a large screen that collapses into scroll card on a small screen (implemented within the top project placeholder), as well as tidying up a few elements, and changing the shadows to be more subtle. Also added placeholder pages and links to the pages. 

### last release
is an initial release that i have to submit so that i can mentally move on to the Java section of the course. I realize now that it doesn't meet the "top article must appear larger" critereon, and that the whole thing should have been developed as 'cards', which i might yet do if there is time later on, but tbh i think this looks better anyway.
