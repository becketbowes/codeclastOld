# chronoclasts
chronoclasts are exactly the type of scum that would mix latin and greek roots, but, you know, in coding.

## this release
is an initial release that i have to submit so that i can mentally move on to the Java section of the course. I realize now that it doesn't meet the "top article must appear larger" critereon, and that the whole thing should have been developed as 'cards', which i might yet do if there is time later on, but tbh i think this looks better anyway.
